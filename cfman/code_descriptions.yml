# Informational Responses

100:
  message: "Continue"
  category: "Informational Responses"
  description: "Confirmation of the initial request to send a response body. The origin server is willing to accept the request (based on the request headers). This is returned before the client typically sends the response body. This prevents clients from sending unnecessary or unusable data. Required from server: If the client sends Expect: 100-continue header, the server must respond immediately with either 100 Continue and continue to read from the input stream or send another response code. Cloudflare uses Keep-Alive connections so this response should not be necessary" 

101:
  message: "Switching Protocol"
  category: "Informational Responses"
  description: "Origin server accepts the client’s request to switch protocols. Client request either contained Upgrade in a header field or there was a change in the application protocol being used on this connection. If using Upgrade header field, the server has agreed to upgrade to a protocol that is higher on the client’s priority list than the current protocol being used. Origin server must also respond with a Upgrade header field to indicate the new protocol(s) to which the connection is being switched It is assumed that this switch will be advantageous to both the client and the server. Most common use case is with websockets. For information about Cloudflare’s Websockets see: Cloudflare Now Supports Websockets."

200:
  message: "OK"
  category: "Successful Responses"
  description: "Everyone’s favorite response: the request has succeeded.\n\nThe response payload will depend on the request method used. The expected response body for the corresponding request method is as follows:\n\nGET -  the headers and data corresponding to the requested resource\nHEAD - just the headers corresponding the requested resource without the actual data\nPOST - the status of, or results obtained from the action\nA 200 response should always have a payload but is not required, thus an origin server may generate a 200 with a zero length. To adhere to RFC standards a 204 should be generated in that case (exception CONNECT)\n\nCacheable by default by proxy servers and browsers. If not specified by Cloudflare cache controls,   static resources with this response will cache default for 2 hours at our edge."

# Successful Responses

201:
  message: "Created"
  category: "Successful Responses"
  description: "Request was successful and there are one or more new resources being created. The new resource’s location is expected to be present at either the Location header field or by the request’s URI. Typically, the payload will describe and reference links to the newly generated resource.\n\nSee RFC 7231 Section 7.2 for a discussion of the meaning and purpose of validator header fields, such as ETag and Last-Modified, in a 201 response."

202:
  message: "Accepted"
  category: "Successful Responses"
  description: "Request was accepted and is currently being processed by the origin server.  Depending on server’s specifications, the client may or may not act on the request while processing actually takes place."

203:
  message: "Non-Authoritative Information"
  category: "Successful Responses"
  description: "Optional replacement of the 200 status code to explain the request was successful but did not come directly from the origin server. Original origin server response has been modified by a proxy or intermediate server. For example, 203’s could be used to inform the client that this resource has been cached at a proxy so a similar future request may or may not hit that cache server with that identical resource. Another example is when a header that is only applicable to the local origin server is stripped.\n\nIs cacheable response by default, however, Cloudflare will not cache.\nCloudflare will never generate but may proxy from other proxies if present. Cloudflare respects origins responses with these exceptions: How does Cloudflare handle HTTP Request headers."

204:
  message: "No Content"
  category: "Successful Responses"
  description: "Requested actions were performed correctly at the origin server. The common use case is in document editors the “save” action is sent to the origin server, yet no payload is needed to be returned to the client. One still might want to alert the user that the save was successful.\n\nThere must never be a payload when returning a 204 response.\nIs cacheable response by default, however, Cloudflare will not cache."

205:
  message: "Reset Content"
  category: "Successful Responses"
  description: "Origin server suggests the client reset the view to its original state prior to the request. Often used in forms or other input submissions were a payload is sent in the request, the origin server operated successfully and now is notifying the browser that additional submissions are permitted.\n\nA 205 response must never return a payload. Content-Length of 0 or chunked responses immediately followed by a close or zero-byte response allowed only."

206:
  message: "Partial Content"
  category: "Successful Responses"
  description: "Request for a part of a resource was successful and is located in the payload. The request must have indicated the range by either of the following:\n\nA single partial request with HTTP headers including Content Range followed by size. (If present in response header must be exactly equal to the octets in the payload) E.g. Content Range: bytes 21010-47021/47022\n\nMultiple chunks with Content-Type: multipart/byteranges in HTTP header and including Content-Range fields for each part individually but not in the response HTTP header. Boundary also required as specified by RFC 7233 Section 4.1 e.g\n\nHTTP/1.1 206 Partial Content\nDate: Wed, 15 Nov 1995 06:25:24 GMT\nLast-Modified: Wed, 15 Nov 1995 04:58:08 GMT\nContent-Length: 1741\nContent-Type: multipart/byteranges; boundary=THIS_STRING_SEPARATES\n\n--THIS_STRING_SEPARATES\nContent-Type: application/pdf\nContent-Range: bytes 500-999/8000\n\n...the first range...\n--THIS_STRING_SEPARATES\nContent-Type: application/pdf\nContent-Range: bytes 7000-7999/8000\n\n...the second range\n--THIS_STRING_SEPARATES--\n\n206’s are useful for clients processing larger files that require split or interrupted downloads with multiple simultaneous streams for improved latency."

  message: "IM Used (HTTP Delta encoding)"
  category: "Successful Responses"
  description: "The server has fulfilled a GET request for the resource, and the \
                response is a representation of the result of one or more \
                instance-manipulations applied to the current instance."

  description: "User-Agent should follow this redirect with a GET request. Note: differs from 301 in that the  resource at the redirect is not necessarily equivalent to what was requested\n\n-- Intended to be used in response to a POST/DELETE request to signal the origin server received data correctly and to allow appropriate cache behaviour.\n-- The original 303 response is not cacheable, but the response to the 2nd request (GET) may be since it’s under a different URI."

304:
  message: "Not Modified"
  category: "Redirection Messages"
  description: "This is used for caching purposes. It tells the client that the \
                response has not been modified, so the client can continue to \

  message: "Use Proxy"
  category: "Redirection Messages"
  description: "Was defined in a previous version of the HTTP specification to \
                indicate that a requested response must be accessed by a proxy. \
                It has been deprecated due to security concerns regarding in-band \

                requested resource at another URI with same method that was used \
                in the prior request. This has the same semantics as the 302 Found \
                HTTP response code, with the exception that the user agent must \
                not change the HTTP method used: If a POST was used in the first \

  message: "Permanent Redirect"
  category: "Redirection Messages"
  description: "This means that the resource is now permanently located at another \

  message: "Unauthorized"
  category: "Client Error Responses"
  description: "Although the HTTP standard specifies 'unauthorized', semantically \

  message: "Forbidden"
  category: "Client Error Responses"
  description: "The client does not have access rights to the content, i.e. they \

404:
  message: "Not Found"
  category: "Client Error Responses"
  description: "The server can not find requested resource. In the browser, this \
                means the URL is not recognized. In an API, this can also mean \
                that the endpoint is valid but the resource itself does not exist. \
                Servers may also send this response instead of 403 to hide the \
                existence of a resource from an unauthorized client. This response \
                code is probably the most famous one due to its frequent occurence \

                the server would like to shut down this unused connection. This \
                response is used much more since some browsers, like Chrome, \
                Firefox 27+, or IE9, use HTTP pre-connection mechanisms to speed \
                up surfing. Also note that some servers merely shut down the \
